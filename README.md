## Project Overview  
The NFL Parlay Picker leverages game, player, and play-by-play data to explore predictive signals in NFL matchups.  
By clustering and modeling historical trends, the project seeks to forecast game outcomes and evaluate how data-driven insights can inform parlay-style predictions, purely for research and analytics purposes.

## Dataset & Goals  

### Dataset  
- **Source:** [nflreadpy](https://github.com/nflverse/nflreadpy) package on GitHub  
- **Content:** NFL game, player, and play-by-play data across multiple historical seasons  

### Goal  
Build a predictive model to forecast NFL outcomes, including:  
- Money line results  
- Point totals (over/under)  
- Weekly game spreads  

### Expected Output  
A model that generates weekly predictions for each NFL game, producing suggested (non-financial) outcomes for:  
- Money lines  
- Over/under totals  
- Point spreads  

**Bonus Objective:**  
- Incorporate player performance-based parlay features to deepen model interpretability and improve predictive accuracy (if time permits).
